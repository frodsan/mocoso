Mocoso
======

Yet Another Simple Stub & Mock library. This is inspired by (stolen from)
[Minitest::Mock][minitest], [Override][override] and [Mocha][mocha].

Motivation
----------

**tl;dr: Il m√≠o capriccio**

Yes, there are a lot of good libraries out there, but I wanted one that
meets the following criteria:

* Always restore stubbed methods to their original implementations.
* Doesn't allow to stub or mock undefined methods.
* Doesn't monkey-patch any class or object.
* Test-framework agnostic (Doesn't need integration code).

And the most important: simplicity.

Installation
------------

    $ gem install mocoso

Usage
-----

A quick example (uses [Cutest][cutest]):

    require "cutest"
    require "mocoso"

    include Mocoso

    test "mocking a class method" do
      user = User.new

      expect(User, :find, with: [1], return: user) do
        assert_equal user, User.find(1)
      end

      assert_equal nil, User.find(1)
    end

    test "stubbing an instance method" do
      user = User.new

      stub(user, :valid?, true) do
        assert user.valid?
      end

      assert !user.valid?
    end
